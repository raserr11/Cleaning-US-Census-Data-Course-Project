## Project Overview
This guided project, as part of my course, focuses on the processing and preliminary analysis of 
demographic and economic data across various U.S. states. The main objectives include cleaning and 
preparing the data, followed by an investigation into income distribution and the relationships between 
different demographic variables.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following variables:
- **State**: The name of the U.S. state.
- **Total Population**: The total population of the state.
- **Hispanic**: Percentage of the population that is Hispanic.
- **White**: Percentage of the population that is White.
- **Black**: Percentage of the population that is Black.
- **Native**: Percentage of the population that is Native American.
- **Asian**: Percentage of the population that is Asian.
- **Pacific**: Percentage of the population that is Pacific Islander.
- **Income**: Average income in the state.
- **Men**: Number of men in the state.
- **Women**: Number of women in the state.

## Project Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:  
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Ensure correct data types and consistency across the dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Investigate the distribution of income across different states.
   - Explore correlations between demographic variables and income.
   - Visualize data to identify any significant patterns or trends.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Calculate and interpret correlations between ethnic composition, income, and gender distribution.
   - Identify which demographic factors are most closely related to income levels.

## Key Questions
This project aims to answer the following questions:
1. **How is income distributed across different states?**  
   Income levels vary significantly by state, with some states showing much higher average incomes than others.

2. **What correlations exist between demographic variables and income?**  
   The analysis reveals moderate correlations between certain ethnic groups and income, particularly
   a positive correlation between the Asian population and income.

## Visualizations
The project includes the following visualizations:
- **Bar plots** to compare income distribution across states.
- **Heatmaps** to show correlations between income and demographic variables.
- **Scatter plots** to explore relationships between specific demographic factors and income.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Visualization libraries to create plots and graphs.
- **Numpy**: Numerical operations and calculations.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed and the required libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
